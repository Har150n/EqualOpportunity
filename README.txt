Equal Opportunity
Our project is a jobsite that mitigates bias and discrimination by allowing employers to censor the personal information of applicants. The webapp was built with Flask.

How to start
Run app.py on your local machine to host the website locally.
navigate to login page of the home page by manualing typing in '/login' into the website directory. Enter "applicant" for both the username and password and press the submit button to be redirected to the open applications webpage. Clicking the positions on the open applications table will redirect the user to an application form where the user is able to submit their application for the selected position. The hide button beside each field on the application form allows the user to censor personal information they do not wish to disclose.
